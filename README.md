# AngularJS Skeleton

This provides a skeleton structure and file templates for medium to large
projects. It takes into account the typical work that need to be done to
provide the best browser compatibility and minification support. It largely
follows the structure and style set by the angular-seed project, but is
enhanced for larger projects.
